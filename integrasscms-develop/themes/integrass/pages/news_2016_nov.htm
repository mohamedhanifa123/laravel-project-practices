                                <p class="text-justify letter-spacing-5 animated fadeInDown">Rajagopalan explains "with some of these larger hospital systems there is a lack of solid IT infrastructure and data management. Generating the analytics can be an arduous task, the data can be cumbersome so producing valuable reports may not possible and executives are not able to make accurate assessments. Data management is essential for hospital systems to make predictive analysis for staffing needs, reduce readmissions and share data between departments. Without a tailored solution some systems will become obsolete which could open the door for major errors and data breech."</p>
