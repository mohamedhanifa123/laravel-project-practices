                    <strong>Introduction </strong>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Integrass, LLC and its subsidiaries collects and uses certain personal information about you through the use of our Website and Platforms, mobile applications, and through email, text, and other electronic communications between you and Integrass.

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website www.Integrass.com or other subsidiary or affiliate websites (together referred to as “Website”), use any other Integrass applications (“Application”), or respond to Integrass communications as well as our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, storing, protecting, and disclosing that information.  
                </p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy <strong>applies</strong> to information we collect: 
                    <ol class="list-unstyled">

                        <li>- in certain third-party applications you have specifically consented to use, whose terms of service or privacy policy(ies) you have agreed to separately; </li>
                        <li>- through printed documents, records, and materials;</li>
                        <li>- when you interact with our advertising, marketing, and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy; and </li>
                        <li>- through a certain third-party application (“modal”), with which you agree to share limited personal information so that Integrass may assist you with Integrass account set-up and send marketing emails to you. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect: 
                    <ol class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>- offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Integrass or any third-party; </li>
                        <li>- through most third-party website or applications, including through any application or content (including advertising or marketing) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website or in the Application. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE WILL TREAT IT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE OUR WEBSITE OR APPLICATION. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE OR APPLICATION, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  </strong></p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of our Website or Application after we make changes shall constitute your acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

                <strong>Children Under the Age of 18 </strong>
                <p>Our Application and Website are not intended for children under the age of 18 and children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use our Website. We will remove any information provided by a child under the age of 18 if we become aware of it. Parents and legal guardians are welcome to provide information on behalf of children under 18 so long as the Parents and legal guardians are overseeing the process.  
                </p>

                <strong>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It </strong>
                <p>We collect different types of information about you, including information that may directly identify you or be used to identify you, information that is about you but individually does not personally identify you, and information that we combine with our other users. This includes information that we collect directly from you or through automated collection technologies. For example, if Integrass uses a Google modal, then this also would include information collected using such modal only after you agree to such access. The hypothetical Google modal would not create a Integrass account, but it could share limited Google account information (e.g., first and last name, email address and locality) with Integrass so that Integrass may assist you in creating a Integrass account and send marketing emails to you.   
                </p>

                <strong>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information </strong>
                <p>We offer you choices on how you can opt out of our use of tracking technology, disclosure of your personal information for third-parties to market or advertise to you, our marketing or advertising to you, and other targeted marketing and advertising. We do not control the collection and use of your information collected by third parties. When possible, these organizations are under contractual obligations to maintain appropriate safeguards and protections, to use this data only for providing the services to us, and to maintain this information strictly confidential. These third parties may, however, aggregate the information they collect with information from their other customers for their own purposes.

                <p>We may use automated data collection technologies to track you across websites. We currently do not honor do-not-track signals that may be sent by some browsers. We also may use automated data collection technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they “do not track” your online activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals and we do not modify what information we collect or how we use that information based upon whether such a signal is broadcast or received by us. </p>

                <strong>Data Security </strong>
                <p>Information transmitted over the Internet is not completely secure, but we do our best to protect your personal information. You can help protect your personal information and other information by keeping your password to our Application and Website confidential. We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted when being communicated between us and you. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. To the extent you are given a username and password, you are responsible for keeping this information confidential. We ask you not to share any password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information on the Website or in Application like message boards and other areas where you may post photographs, videos or other content. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website or Application. Although we do our best to protect 
                    your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to or from our Application or Website.
