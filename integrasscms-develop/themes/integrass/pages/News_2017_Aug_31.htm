(Aug. 31, 2017) — Across Borders Management Consulting Group LLC dba Integrass, a thriving technology solutions provider, is expanding to two new markets across the Southeast. </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-justify letter-spacing-5 animated fadeInDown">The company, which is based in Central Florida, will enter the South Florida market with an office in Fort Lauderdale.
