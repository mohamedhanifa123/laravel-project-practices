                    computer hardware products, (b) computer software products, and (c) third party computer
                    hardware/software services (collectively, the <strong>“Products”</strong>) from Integrass Systems,
                    Inc., and its
                    affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, and contractors (<strong>“Integrass”</strong> or
                    <strong>“us”</strong> or <strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“our”</strong>).
                    All third parties referenced above include manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers and shall
                    be
                    hereinafter referred to as a <strong>“Supplier”</strong>. If you purchase a Service through
                    virtualops.Integrass.com
                    (the <strong>“Website”</strong>), use of the Website is also governed by our Terms of Use and
                    Privacy
                    Policy.
                    Descriptions of the Services and applicable Fees are available on the Website and/or in a
                    written
                    work order or statement of work between you and Integrass (each a <strong>“Service

                    Service Description(s) for the Services that you purchase are part of these Terms. These
                    Terms, the
                    Managed IT as a Service Agreement, and other referenced documents together constitute a
                    binding
                    legal agreement (the <strong>“Agreement”</strong>) between you and Integrass. Different or
                    additional terms apply to
                    other products and services that we sell. References to “you” in these Terms means
                    the individual or
                    company receiving Services under the Agreement.</p>
                <h4>SETTING UP A CUSTOMER ACCOUNT; RELIANCE ON CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>1. You may be required to hold a customer account (an “Account”) in order to purchase Services.
                        By establishing an Account, you confirm that (a) you are the age of majority in your state; (b)
                        you have the legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement; and (c) you or your

                    </li>
                    <li>2. Your Account is specific to you. You are responsible for all use of your Account, even if
                        such use is without your permission. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
                        your Account log-in information and monitoring your Account for unauthorized use. Promptly
                        report any unauthorized use to Integrass.
                    </li>
                    <li>3. You agree that we may record, store, and monitor communications between you and Integrass.
                        You grant Integrass a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty free license to use comments,
                        feedback, materials, or information submitted by you to provide the Services and for any other
                        purpose permitted by our Privacy Policy.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>LIMITATIONS ON USE AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES AND PRODUCTS</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>4 Your use of our Services is solely for your internal personal or business purposes. You may
                        not resell or transfer the Services to other persons or entities, or use the Services to compete
                        with us. You may not sell, lease, subcontract, sublicense or rent access to the Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>5 Services are subject to the availability of equipment, parts, software licenses, and other
                        materials. Services include only the services, software, hardware, and peripherals specified in
                        the Service Description. Services, including, features, software, hardware, and peripherals, may
                        change from time-to-time without prior notice, and Integrass may modify a Service Description by
                        posting an updated version on the Website. If there is a material change to the Services, you
                        have 15 days from the date of the material change to cancel your Service.
                    </li>
                    <li>6 Integrass may, at any time and without notice or liability, restrict the use of Services or
                        limit their availability. Circumstances beyond our control may impact our ability to deliver
                        Services and we will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance due to such
                        causes, including an inability to obtain necessary equipment. In cases when Integrass is
                        dependent upon Supplier’s availability of Services or Products, Integrass cannot guarantee any
                        particular delivery date and shall not be liable for delay or any inability to provide Services
                        or ship Products due to availability or allocation, labor disputes or other causes beyond its
                        reasonable control. If Integrass is unable to deliver the Services or Products on the delivery
                        date requested in the Agreement, Integrass will attempt to notify you by telephone or electronic
                        communication. Unless you elect to cancel the Service or Product order within one (1) business
                        day of receipt of such notice, such estimated delivery date shall become the new delivery date.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>ONSITE SERVICES</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>7 Services subject to this Agreement are provided at your residence or office. Integrass will
                        use reasonable efforts to schedule a mutually convenient time. You release Integrass from any
                        and all liability for any direct or indirect damages resulting from delays in the provision of
                        onsite Services. If connection to an in-home or office network is required, access to the
                        network configuration (i.e. TCP/IP address, etc.), user IDs, addresses, passwords, and authority
                        will be required. You must provide an accessible work area for the technician and a suitable
                        working area for the assembly of any equipment. If required by the work order, the location must
                        have working high-speed broadband (DSL, cable modem, satellite) internet access and power. You
                        or an authorized representative, age eighteen (18) or older, must be present the entire time
                        work is being performed at your premises.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>REMOTE SERVICES</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>8. Consult the Service Description and the Website for details on when remote Services are
                        available and how to access them. If your use of or access to the Services requires internet
                        access, you must ensure that you have internet connectivity and that your computer environment
                        is otherwise suitable to receive the Services. Prior to providing a Service to you, we may
                        qualify your internet connection using our standard qualification procedures to determine
                        whether you have the minimum required speed; however, some computers and other devices may not
                        be able to receive Services even if testing shows that your connection is qualified.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>PRODUCT ORDERS</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>9. Integrass Product orders are placed through the Managed IT as a Service Agreement, or any
                        amendment to it, between you and Integrass. Title to the Products, free and clear of all
                        third-party liens and security interests, shall pass to you when the Products are delivered to
                        the carrier used to ship the Products to you. If Integrass’s carrier is used to ship the
                        Products, shipping charges shall be invoiced to you and Integrass will assume risk of loss of
                        the Products until the Products are delivered to the location designated by you, at which time
                        risk of loss shall pass to you. If you designate a carrier to ship the Products, risk of loss to
                        the Products shall pass to you when the Products are delivered to the carrier.
                    </li>

                    <li>10. After termination of this Agreement, Products may no longer be ordered under this Agreement.
                        Product orders received and accepted prior to termination of this Agreement shall continue to be
                        binding orders, and such Product orders will remain subject to the terms of this Agreement until
                        completion. Product orders are only cancelable if a party (a) ceases to conduct business in the
                        normal course, (b) becomes insolvent, (c) makes a general assignment for the benefit of
                        creditors, (d) avails itself of, or becomes subject to, any proceeding under any bankruptcy laws
                        relating to insolvency or protection from creditors, or (e) fails to cure any material breach of
                        any of its other obligations under this Agreement within thirty (30) days of receiving written
                        notice specifying the basis for the breach. Each party shall retain all remedies for breach it
                        may have against the other party if at any time either party becomes bankrupt, insolvent, or
                        makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
                    </li>

                    <li>11. If a Product is damaged upon receipt by you, you must call customer service and arrange to
                        return it in order to accept a replacement.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>ACCESS TO EQUIPMENT AND USE OF SOFTWARE</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>12. You hereby authorize us to connect to, access and control your equipment as necessary to
                        receive the Services. This includes the right to inspect and open the equipment, to access and
                        remove internal components or perform repairs, depending on the applicable Services.
                    </li>

                    <li>13. In connection with the Services, we may recommend that you acquire, install, and use software
                        that is owned or licensed by Integrass (<strong>“Integrass Software”</strong>) or software from
                        third-party
                        licensors, providers and suppliers (<strong>“Third-Party Software”</strong> and, together with
                        the Integrass
                        Software, the <strong>“Software”</strong>). The Software may be provided as part of the
                        applicable Fees for the
                        Services or for an additional Fee, depending on the Software. Integrass hereby grants you a
                        revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Integrass Software in connection
                        with the Services subject to the terms of any accompanying end user license agreement and this
                        Agreement until the end of the Services or until Integrass terminates the license. Third Party
                        Software is licensed to you by its owners or licensors.
                    </li>

                    <li>14. We provide technical assistance and support for the Software in accordance with our policies.
                        If we provide technical assistance and support to you for Third Party Software, you must ensure
                        that you comply with the terms and conditions under which you licensed such Third-Party
                        Software. <strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUPPORT
                            OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE BY AN UNAUTHORIZED SERVICE PROVIDER MAY VOID ANY WARRANTY MADE BY
                            THE

                <h4>PROPRIETARY MATERIALS; BACKUP OF YOUR DATA; AND OUR USE OF SERVICE DATA</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>15. Each of us owns our own respective data and proprietary materials and the respective
                        developments and works we create in connection with the Services, provided that any improvements
                        to software shall be owned by the owner of the software. You hereby assign all intellectual
                        property rights in Integrass Software, including patent, copyright and trademark rights therein
                        to Integrass and agree to cooperate with us to take such actions and execute such documents as
                        necessary to transfer such rights. We will not provide backup copies or support installation of
                        unlicensed software. You represent and warrant that all software and data installed or
                        accessible on your equipment is properly licensed to, or owned by, you.
                    </li>

                    <li>16. UNLESS WE ARE PROVIDING DATA BACKUP AS PART OF THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
                        YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING AND PERFORMING A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE BACKUP OF
                        ALL DATA AND SOFTWARE STORED ON ANY EQUIPMENT OR DEVICE BEFORE PROVIDING ACCESS TO SUCH

                        AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WHATSOEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR ANY
                        LOSS, DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION, HARM OR CORRUPTION THAT MAY ARISE FROM OR BE RELATED IN ANY WAY TO

                <h4>TERM AND TERMINATION; AUTOMATIC RENEWAL</h4>
                <ol class="list-type-none">
                    <li>17. This Agreement begins upon our acceptance of this Agreement and shall continue until
                        terminated by you or Integrass. Services may be provided on a one-off
                        (<strong>“Project”</strong>) basis or on a
                        renewing subscription basis (<strong>“Subscription Services”</strong>). Subscription Services
                        are subject to an
                        initial contractual term (the <strong>“Initial Term”</strong>) as set forth in the Service
                        Description. At the
                        end of the Initial Term, your Services will continue on a month-to-month basis. To terminate a
                        Subscription Service, you must give Integrass notice of your intent to terminate in writing no
                        less than 30 days before the end of the then-current term in order to avoid being charged the
                        applicable Fee for the next period. In the event a Services contract is terminated, you are
                        still responsible for paying for any Products ordered.
                    </li>

                    <li>18. If, during the Initial Term of a Subscription Service, you terminate the Agreement or
                        Integrass terminates your Agreement for cause, you will be responsible for payment of an early
                        termination fee (<strong>“ETF”</strong>) equal to 50% of the balance due for the remaining
                        period of the Initial
                        Term. You may change your Subscription Services plan by contacting our customer service
                        department. If you upgrade to a higher tier Subscription Services plan, you will not be charged
                        an ETF. If you downgrade your Subscription Services plan, you will be assessed an ETF equal to
                        25% of the balance due for the remaining period of the Initial Term of your original
                        Subscription Services plan. Changes to your Subscription Services plan will result in a new
                        Initial Term. You are responsible for returning any equipment, hardware, software, or product
                        provided as part of the Services to Integrass within 30 days of termination. Equipment,
                        hardware, software, and product must be returned in good, serviceable condition, normal wear and
                        tear excepted. If equipment, hardware, software, or product is not received by Integrass within
                        30 days of termination, you will be charged full list price for the item.
                    </li>

                    <li> 19. In the event you are in breach of any of the terms of this Agreement, Integrass will
                        attempt
