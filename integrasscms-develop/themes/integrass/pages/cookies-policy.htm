                                            sites,
                                            that third party organization may set a cookie that allows that organization

                                            recognize you. The third party organization may use that cookie for its own
                                            purposes. The organization may also show you ads and content from us when

                                        <p>Also, if you use a social media-sharing button or widget on one of our sites,
                                            the social network that created the button will record your action for its

                                            purposes.</p>
                                        <p>Please look to each social media organization’s privacy and data protection
                                            policy to understand (a) its use of cookies; (b) how it tracks you from our

                                        <p> We use tracking and targeting cookies or ask other companies to do so on our
                                            behalf to send you emails and show you online advertising that meets your
                                            business and professional interests. If you have registered for our websites
                                            or
                                            submitted information through an online form on one of our websites, we may
                                            tailor our emails to you to reflect the interests you have shown during your

                                        <p>We ask third party advertising platforms and technology companies to show you
                                            our ads after you leave our sites. This is known as ‘retargeting
                                            technology’.
                                            This technology allows us to make our website services more interesting for
                                            you.
                                            Retargeting cookies are used to record anonymized movement patterns on a
                                            website. These patterns are used to tailor banner advertisements to your
                                            interests. The data used for retargeting is completely anonymous and is only
                                            used for statistical analysis. No personal data is stored and the use of
                                            retargeting technology is subject to the applicable statutory data

                                        <p>We also work with companies to reach people who have not visited our sites.
                                            These companies do not identify you as an individual but instead rely on a
                                            variety of other data to show you advertisements, for example, behavior
                                            across
                                            websites, information about individual devices and, in some cases, IP
                                            addresses.</p>
                                        <p>How do I turn off cookies?</p>
