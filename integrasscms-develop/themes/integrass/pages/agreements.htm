                        CUSTOMER
                        OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF CUSTOMER’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.</p>
                    <p>CUSTOMER SHALL REVIEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE’S DOCUMENTATION DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD TO BECOME
                        FAMILIAR WITH THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE.</p>
                    <p>2.6 <strong>Free Services.</strong> INTEGRASS may make Free Services available to Customer. Use
                        of
                        Free Services is
                        subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this
                        section and any other portion of this Agreement, this section shall control. Free Services are
                        provided to Customer without charge up to certain limits as described in the Documentation.
                        Usage
                        over these limits requires Customer’s purchase of additional resources or services. Customer
                        agrees
                        that INTEGRASS, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate Customer’s access
                        to
                        the Free Services or any part thereof. Customer agrees that any termination of Customer’s access
                        to
                        the Free Services may be without prior notice, and Customer agrees that INTEGRASS will not be
                        liable
                        to Customer or any third party for such termination. Customer is solely responsible for
                        exporting
                        Customer Data from the Free Services prior to termination of Customer’s access to the Free
                        Services
                        for any reason, provided that if INTEGRASS terminates Customer’s account, except as required by
                        law
                        INTEGRASS will provide Customer a reasonable opportunity to retrieve its Customer Data.</p>

                        rights, INTEGRASS may discontinue Customer’s access to Content through the Services.</p>

                        agreement for services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of
                        amounts Customer has authorized INTEGRASS to charge to Customer’s credit card), INTEGRASS may,
                        without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations
                        under
                        such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend
                        Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for customers paying by
                        credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, INTEGRASS will give Customer at
                        least
                        10 days’ prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with the “Manner of Giving
                        Notice”
                        section below for billing notices, before suspending services to Customer.</p>
                    <p>5.5 <strong>Payment Disputes.</strong> INTEGRASS will not exercise its rights under the “Overdue
                        Charges” or
                        “Suspension of Service and Acceleration” section above if Customer is disputing the applicable
                        charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>
                    <p>5.6<strong> Taxes.</strong> INTEGRASS's fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar
                        governmental
                        assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes,
                        assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for
                        paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If INTEGRASS has the legal obligation
                        to
                        pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, INTEGRASS will
                        invoice
                        Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides INTEGRASS with a valid tax
                        exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, INTEGRASS is
                        solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.

                <h5 class="text-center">7. CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>
                <div class="ml-4">
                    <p>7.1 <strong>Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> “Confidential Information” means all
                        information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”),
                        whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be
                        understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of
                        disclosure. Confidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data; Confidential
                        Information of
                        INTEGRASS includes the Services and Content, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
                        all
                        Order Forms (including pricing). Confidential Information of each party includes business and
                        marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business
                        processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any
                        information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any
                        obligation
                        owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by
                        the
                        Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is
                        received
                        from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was
                        independently developed by the Receiving Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure
                        obligations set forth in this “Confidentiality” section apply to Confidential Information
                        exchanged
                        between the parties in connection with the evaluation of additional INTEGRASS services.</p>
                    <p>7.2 <strong>Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> As between the parties, each party
                        retains all
                        ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same
                        degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information
                        of
                        like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the
                        Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as
                        otherwise
                        authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the
                        Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that
                        access
                        for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with
                        the
                        Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential
                        Information than those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any
                        Order
                        Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the
                        other
                        party’s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its
                        Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal
                        counsel’s or accountant’s compliance with this “Confidentiality” section. Notwithstanding the
                        foregoing, INTEGRASS may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form to a
                        subcontractor or Non-INTEGRASS Application Provider to the extent necessary to perform
                        INTEGRASS’s
                        obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set
                        forth herein.</p>
                    <p>7.3 <strong>Compelled Disclosure.</strong> The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
                        Information
                        of the
                        Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the
                        Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and
                        reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest
                        the
                        disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s
                        Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party,
                        and
                        the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the
                        Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that
                        Confidential Information.</p>

                        (a
                        “Claim Against Customer”), and will indemnify Customer from any damages, attorney fees and costs

                        settlement

                        Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or
                        employment
                        relationship between the parties. Each party will be solely responsible for payment of all
                        compensation owed to its employees, as well as all employment-related taxes.</p>
                    <p>12.5 <strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> There are no third-party beneficiaries under

                        consent
                        (not to be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, either party may assign this Agreement in
                        its
                        entirety (including all Order Forms), without the other party’s consent to its Affiliate or in

                        all
                        of its assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party is acquired by, sells substantially all

                        its assets to, or undergoes a change of control in favor of, a direct competitor of the other
                        party,
                        then such other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice. In the event of such a
                        termination, INTEGRASS will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term
                        of
                        all subscriptions for the period after the effective date of such termination. Subject to the

                        successors and permitted assigns.</p>

                        assumes
                        no warranty or liability for Content. The parties agree that the “Reporting of Defects”,
                        “Remedies
                        resulting from Defects” and “Exclusions” section shall apply accordingly to INTEGRASS’s
                        responsibility in the event INTEGRASS is deemed responsible for Content by a court of
                        competent
                        jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>13.3 <strong>Reporting of Defects.</strong> Customer shall report any deviation of the
                        Services from
                        the “Agreed Quality of the Services” section (“Defect”) to INTEGRASS in writing without
                        undue delay
                        and shall submit a detailed description of the Defect or, if not possible, of the symptoms
                        of the
                        Defect. Customer shall forward to INTEGRASS any useful information available to Customer for
                        rectification of the Defect.
                    </p>
                    <p>13.4 <strong>Remedies resulting from Defects.</strong> INTEGRASS shall rectify any Defect
                        within a
                        reasonable
                        period of time. If such rectification fails, Customer may terminate the respective Order
                        Form
                        provided that INTEGRASS had enough time for curing the Defect. The “Refund or Payment upon
                        Termination” section, sentence and 1 and sentence 3 shall apply accordingly. If INTEGRASS is
                        responsible for the Defect or if INTEGRASS is in default with the rectification, Customer
                        may assert
                        claims for the damage caused in the scope specified in the “Limitation of Liability” section
                        below.

                    </p>
                    <p>13.6 <strong>Exclusions.</strong> Customer shall have no claims under this “Warranty”
                        if a
                        Defect was caused by the Services not being used by Customer in accordance with the
                        provisions of
